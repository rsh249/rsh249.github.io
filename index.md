## Biosketch: Spatial Biodiversity Informatics -- Data mining for the past, present, and future of ecological change on earth.

Currently, I am a Gerstner Scholar in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Projects here include using fossil plant community composition to generate paleoclimate estimates of Late Quaternary climate in Western North America. I am also developing a project to attempt to reconstruct plant communities from ancient DNA extracted from packrat paleomiddens.

I am broadly interested in trying to illuminate the processes and factors determining global patterns of biodiversity. Everything from individual species distributions to the great latitudinal species diversity gradients and the distribution of functional traits are the fascinating result of biological processes and the environment.
