## Biosketch: Spatial Biodiversity Informatics -- Data mining for the past, present, and future of ecological change on earth.

I am a new Assistant Professor at Stonehill College in Easton, MA. I teach Bioinformatics, Botany, and Intro. Biology courses. My current projects include using fossil plant community composition to generate paleoclimate estimates of Late Quaternary climate in Western North America. I am also developing a project to attempt to reconstruct plant communities from ancient DNA extracted from packrat paleomiddens.

I am broadly interested in trying to illuminate the processes determining global patterns of biodiversity. Everything from individual species distributions to the great latitudinal species diversity gradients and the distribution of functional traits are the fascinating result of biological processes and the environment.
